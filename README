tpt-font-editor
===============

  A program to create and modify the font data used in The Powder Toy. 
  The program is not my work, it is the work of Stanislaw Skowronek, 
  except this was never packaged individually.

  This program has been extracted from 
  https://github.com/FacialTurd/The-Powder-Toy/tree/legacy/font/


Compilation
-----------
    
    $ mkdir build
    $ make
    or...
    $ make lin
  
  Builds all Linux/etc binaries.

    > mkdir build
    > make win

  Builds all Windows binaries.

    $ make %
    > make %.exe

  Builds a specific binary.


Usage
-----

  Packer
  ~~~~~~

    From font.bin generates an usable font.h file (Forward the output to 
    a file) 

    Usage: packer > font.h

  Unpacker
  ~~~~~~~~

    From current font.h generates a font.bin file which can be used in the 
    editor. 

    Usage: unpacker

  Editor
  ~~~~~~

    Click to toggle particle lightness in four states: 
    white, light gray, dark gray, black. 

    Click and drag the red line to specify the character's right edge. This is 
    to make the font dynamic-width. 

    You won't need to change the green or blue line: those indicate 
    font height and baseline respectively.


    Press Q or Escape to close the program.
    Press Space or = or the right arrow key to move to the next character.
    Press Backspace or - or the left arrow key to move to the previous character.
